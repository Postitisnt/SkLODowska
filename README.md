# SkLODowska Project

Final Project for the course "Knowledge Organization and Cultural Heritage" (KO&CH). </br>Professor Tomasi F.</br>
This project was aimed at producing a KO (Knowledge Organization) work about [LOD](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/linked-open-data) (Linked Open Data) in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) domain.</br>
We took inspiration from one of the greatest scientists of all time, [Marie Slodowska Curie](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/), and developed a website to present and describe the workflow and the final production.

This project has been realized in collaboration with [Battisti T.](https://github.com/tommasobattisti) and [Grieco G.](https://github.com/teragramgius)
