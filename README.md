This repository contains the models and the final website produced for the "Knowledge Organization &amp; Cultural Heritage" (KO&amp;CH) course of the DHDK master's degree. </br>Professor Tomasi F.
#
The aim of this course was to develop an original KO (Knowledge Organization) project about LOD (Linked Open Data) in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) domain.</br>
We took inspiration from the life and the discoveries of one of the greatest scientist of all time: Marie S. Curie.</br>
To see the workflow of the project, as well as the final production, you can take a look at the website through which we presented our results: [SkLODowska](sklodowskaproject.github.io/).
      
The project has been realized in collaboration with [Battisti T.](https://github.com/tommasobattisti) and [Grieco G.](https://github.com/teragramgius)
